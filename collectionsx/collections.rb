# Collections Practice
 
# 1. sort the following array in ascending order
  my_array = ["blake", "ashley", "scott"]
  my_array.sort
# 2. sort the following array in descending order]
  my_array.sort.reverse
# 3. put the following array in reverse order
  my_array.reverse
# 4. grab the second element in the array
  my_array[1]
# 5. print each element of the array to the console
  my_array.each do |name|
    puts name
  end
# 6. create a new array in the following order (see below) using the prior array
 #  ["blake", "scott", "ashley"]
  my_array[1] = "scott"
  my_array[2] = "ashley"
  #or
  my_array.replace([blake, scott, ashley])
  #or
  my_array.values_at(0,2,1)
  #or
  scott = my_array.pop
  array.insert(1, scott)
  #or
  my_array(1, my_array.delete_at(2))
  new_array = my_array[0], my_array[2], my_array[1]
# 7. using the "my_array" array create a hash where the elements in the array are the keys and the values of the hash are those elements with the 3rd character changed to a dollar sign.
    hash = {}
    my_array.each do |name|
       hash[name] = name[0..1] + "$" + name[3..name.length]
    end
    #or
    my_array.each do |name|
       hash[name] = name.gsub(name[2],"$")
    end
    my_hash_7 = { :blake => bl$ke, :ashley => as$ley, :scott => sc$tt }
    # first attempt at converting array into hash, does not work: my_hash = my_array(3) { Hash.new }
# 8. create a hash with two keys, "greater_than_10", "less_than_10" and their values will be an array of any numbers greater than 10 or less than 10 in the following array
    my_array_8 = [100, 1000, 5, 2, 3, 15, 1, 1, 100 ]
    my_hash_8 = {:greater_than_10 => [], :less_than_10 => [], :equal_to_10 => []}
    my_array_8.each do |num|
        if num < 10
          my_hash_8[:less_than_10] << num
        elsif num > 10
          my_hash_8[:greater_than_10] << num
        elsif num == 10
          my_hash_8[:equal_to_10] << num
        end
      end
# 9. find all the winners and put them in an array
    my_hash_9 = { :blake => "winner", :ashley => "loser", :caroline => "loser", :carlos => "winner" }
    winners_9 = []
    my_hash_9.each do |key,value|
      value == "winner" ? winners_9 << key : nil
    end
# 10. add the following arrays
  array_10a = [1,2,3]
  array_10b = [5,9,4]
  array_10c = array_10a + array_10b
  #or
  [1, 2, 3].push([5, 9, 4]).flatten
  #or
  [1,2,3].concat([5,9,4])
  #or
  [1,2,3] | [5,9,4]
# 11. find all words that begin with "a" in the following array
  array_11 = ["apple", "orange", "pear", "avis", "arlo", "ascot" ]
  array_11.each do |element|
    if element[0] == "a"
      put element
    end
    #or
   array_11.select{|item| item[0] == "a" }
   #or
   container = []
   array_11.each do |item|
       if item[0] == "a"
           container << item
       end
       container
   end
   #or
   container = []
   array_11.each do |item|
       if item[0] == "a"
           container << item
       end
       container
   end
   #or
   array_11.select {|word| /^a/.match(word)}
# 12. sum all the numbers in the following array
  array_12 = [11,4,7,8,9,100,134]
  sum_12 = 0
  array_12.each { |num| sum_12 += num }
# 13. Add an "s" to each word in the array except for the 2nd element in the array
  array_13 = ["hand","feet", "knee", "table"]
  count_13 = 0
  array_13.each do |noun|
    count_13 += 1
    next if count == 2
    array_13[count_13 - 1]= "#{noun}s"
  end

# "The summer of tenth grade was the best summer of my life.  I went to the beach everyday and we had amazing weather.  The weather didnt really vary much and was always pretty hot although sometimes at night it would rain.  I didnt mind the rain because it would cool everything down and allow us to sleep peacefully.  Its amazing how much the weather affects your mood.  Who would have thought that I could write a whole essay just about the weather in tenth grade.  Its kind of amazing right?  Youd think for such an interesting person I might have more to say but you would be wrong"
 
# Count how many times each word appears in my story.
# Tip: You'll need to use Hash.new(0) to do this rather than creating a hash using literal syntax like {}.
